# Kubernetes Image Builder

This is the official documentation for the Kubernetes [Image Builder](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/image-builder).

## Introduction

The Kubernetes Image Builder is a SIG Cluster Lifecycle sponsored project for building Kubernetes virtual machine images across multiple infrastructure providers. The resulting VM images are specifically intended to be used with [Cluster API](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/cluster-api) but should be suitable for other setups that rely on Kubeadm.
